# Stealth Lock
A screen lock for the GNOME Shell inspired by xtrlock. This extension gives you an alternative way of locking your screen beside using GDM.

The main idea comes from xtrlock, but that package only works for x11. As I am on GNOME Mutter (Wayland), I decided to develop an extension for the GNOME Shell that can achieve the same thing (and more, hopefully).

## Why?
I like locking my screen, but I don't like having my system going to a different screen to do it. So instead of a lock screen, I want a screen lock.

## PSA
I have little to zero knowledge about GNOME Shell extensions, let alone develop it. So this extension has been basically birthed to life by vibe-coding, although I do possess programming skills to steer the AI towards a certain direction that's not entirely absolutely trash code.
